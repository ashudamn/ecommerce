# Ecommerce
This app can be started by first running `npm install`
and then `npm start`.
## Logic
Products are fetched from json typicode api.
#
And then shown in UI for persistance after refresh redux persist is used.
#
Adding product and removal in cart is implemented by redux.
#
Appropriate alerts are shown for adding new product,updating product and deleting product from All products page. Even if any operation gets failed appropriate message is shown to user.
#
Hash based routing is used as normal routing is not supported in github pages.
You can see app component for routing paths.
